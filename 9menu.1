.SH DESCRIPTION
.I 9menu
is a simple program that accepts a list of menu item and command
pairs on the command line.
It creates a window that consists of nothing but a menu.
When a particular item is selected, the corresponding command is executed.
.PP
Menu items and commands are separated by a colon.  The colon and command
are optional. If they are missing, then the menu item is assumed to be
the name of a program that can be executed directly.
.PP
A menu item consisting of the word
.B exit
will cause
.I 9menu
to exit.
Otherwise, the menu should be deleted from the window manager.
The
.B exit
menu item can be anywhere in the list, although by convention it is last.
If a command is supplied along with the
.B exit
item, that command will be executed before
.I 9menu
exits.
.PP
.I 9menu
accepts the following command line options.
.RS
.TP
.BI \-display " displayname"
Use the X display
.IR displayname ,
instead of the default display.
.TP
.BI \-font " fname"
Use the font
.IR fname ,
instead of one of the default fonts built into
.IR 9wm .
.TP
.BI \-label " name"
Change both the window and icon labels of the window to
.IR name .
The default label is the last componenet of the path used to run
.IR 9menu ,
typically,
.BR 9menu .
.TP
.B \-popup
Act like a pop-up menu. Once a menu item is selected,
.I 9menu
will exit.
This option overrides
.BR \-popdown .
.TP
.B \-popdown
Once an item is selected, the menu window will automatically iconify itself.
.TP
.B \-iconic
Start up in the iconified state.
.TP
.BI \-geometry " geom"
Use
.I geom
(a geometry in standard X format) as the geometry of the menu.
This is most useful for specifying the initial location of the menu.
.I 9menu
will override the size part of the geometry specification. The window will
always be just large enough to hold the menu.
.TP
.B \-version
This option prints the version of
.I 9menu
on the standard output, and then exits.
